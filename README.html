I modified Sauerbraten to have the slowmotion machanics of super hot

original game: http://sauerbraten.org/

Im not the best programmer, this is just an hacky implementation of slowmotion.

the game is already build just start sauerbraten.bat
this will start the 64 bit version, for the 32bit version you will need to compile it yourself
